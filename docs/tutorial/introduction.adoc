== Introduction

TODO: Link the resulting application code repository in this section when it gets published.

This tutorial explains how to use Polymer elements in Angular 2 applications with the help of the [literal]`https://github.com/vaadin/angular2-polymer[@vaadin/angular2-polymer]` directives.

For this purpose we are going to create a staff management application similar to the https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/[Tour of Heroes] example. But unlike in the Angular 2 Tour of Heroes, instead of implementing the UI elements in place, weâ€™ll use the ready-made UI elements that are built on top of the Web Components technology stack. The resulting application will have a nice-looking mobile-first Material designed UI.

=== The Start Point

This tutorial is based on the https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html[Angular 2 5 min QuickStart] and the https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/[Angular 2 Tour of Heroes]. We are going to start from the empty application source from the https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html[QuickStart repository].

If you are not yet familiar with Angular 2, please walk through the Angular 2 QuickStart and the Tour of Heroes first. In this tutorial we are going to skip the explanations that are already given in Angular 2 tutorials.

=== The End Result

In our heroes management application there will be two UI screens. This is the first screen with the list of all heroes made with Vaadin Grid of https://vaadin.com/elements[Vaadin Elements]:

By clicking on a grid row, the user can open the the hero detail editor screen. It is made using Paper Input and Vaadin DatePicker:

Both screens have a context-sensitive toolbar at the top, containing the title and the optional back icon button.
